### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Actually, my main project is a little OS kernel, that i write from scratch using C and ASM for i386 CPU
- I can use C, C# and a little of C++ (and AppleScript but this language is a meme)
- I love the free software philosophy !
- The only closed source project to which I contribute is a game with some friend (here is our <a href="https://discord.gg/5C39sY5ye4"> discord </a>)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: It (no, seriously, you will never know)
- You can reach me [by mail](mailto:freeloo.public@gmail.com) but I am useless
